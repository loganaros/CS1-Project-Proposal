# CS1-Project-Proposal
1. What tech stack will you use for your final project? We recommend that you use
React and Node for this project, however if you are extremely interested in
becoming a Python developer you are welcome to use Python/Flask for this
project.

I will use python and Flask for this project, to get experience in python as well as simplify the back-end routing for myself.

3. Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are
you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?

It will be mostly focused on back-end functionality, utilizing APIs and AI to generate the information and then some UI elements to add customization and make it more user friendly and appealing to use.

5. Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?

A website.

6. What goal will your project be designed to achieve?

To be a fun way to generate completely unique, interesting and fun customizable outfits that are contextually accurate based on location and weather.

7. What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?

The demographic is mainly teenagers to young adults, who are fashion forward and heavy social media users and content creators, as well as influencers.

9. What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind
of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and
populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack are required to create
your own API.

I am going to be using a weather data API, as well as openai's api for GPT's and image generation for the outfits.
